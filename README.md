## QUICK START

this is just to get everyone started on creating branches, fetch master repo, and start committing new code.

- git pull origin master
- git checkout -b [insert branch name]
- git add .
- git commit -m "insert message here"
- git push origin [insert branch name]
- on REPO, create Merge Pull Request and check for conflicts.

No need for peer review if you know for sure this wont brick anything. Once you are done and want to keep going.

- git checkout master
- git pull origin master
- and so on...

## PROGRESS SO FAR

- Added routing to "/" landing page component and "/board/ to go to the kanban board component
- Added packages, redux, redux-react, styled-components, spring
- Added GlobalStyles component that does our CSS Reset + Box Model sizing, imported "Lato" google fonts as default font.
